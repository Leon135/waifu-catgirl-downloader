Wonder how it was made?

I saw [CatgirlDownloader](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/CatgirlDownloader/tree/master) made by NyArch linux and I liked it.

But there was no Windows/web version, so I made my own in React as a learning project.

It uses [waifu.im](https://waifu.im/docs) and [nekos.moe](https://docs.nekos.moe/) APIs to fetch images.
