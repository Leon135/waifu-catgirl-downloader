# Waifu & Catgirl Downloader

A simple, lightweight web app to download random waifus and catgirls. Because sometimes you just need some anime girls in your life.

## Description

This project started as a learning exercise inspired by [CatgirlDownloader](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/CatgirlDownloader) by NyArch Linux. While the original was great, it lacked a Windows/Web version, so I decided to build my own in React.

I will revrite it in Astro eventually, but for now, it's a React app. Didn't know about astro back then.
